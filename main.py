Creating a real-time live traffic monitoring system using computer vision and machine learning is a complex project. I'll provide a basic framework of how such a system could be structured in Python. We will use a combination of OpenCV for computer vision and a simple pre-trained machine learning model to detect vehicles in a video feed. This example assumes you have access to a CCTV camera feed or video file.

The following program consists of detecting vehicles using a pre-trained deep learning model for object detection such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or a similar model. For simplicity, I'll simulate a traffic camera using a video file.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import time

# Load YOLO pre-trained model and configuration files
MODEL_WEIGHTS = "yolov3.weights"  # Replace with the path to your YOLO weights
MODEL_CONFIG = "yolov3.cfg"  # Replace with the path to your YOLO config
LABELS_FILE = "coco.names"  # Replace with the path to COCO names
video_file = "traffic.mp4"  # Replace with your CCTV camera feed/video file

# Load class labels
with open(LABELS_FILE, 'r') as f:
    LABELS = f.read().strip().split('\n')

# Load YOLO model
net = cv2.dnn.readNetFromDarknet(MODEL_CONFIG, MODEL_WEIGHTS)

# Determine output layer names from YOLO
layer_names = net.getLayerNames()
output_layers = [layer_names[i[0] - 1] for i in net.getUnconnectedOutLayers()]

# Capture video
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_file)

def process_frame(frame):
    try:
        # Construct a blob from the frame
        blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, scalefactor=1/255.0, size=(416, 416), swapRB=True, crop=False)
        net.setInput(blob)
        
        # Perform forward pass and get detections
        detections = net.forward(output_layers)
        
        # Initialize lists
        confidences = []
        boxes = []
        
        # Iterate over each detection
        for detection in detections:
            for obj in detection:
                scores = obj[5:]
                class_id = np.argmax(scores)
                confidence = scores[class_id]

                # Filter out weak detections and focus on vehicles
                if confidence > 0.5 and (LABELS[class_id] == "car" or LABELS[class_id] == "bus" or LABELS[class_id] == "truck"):
                    box = obj[0:4] * np.array([frame.shape[1], frame.shape[0], frame.shape[1], frame.shape[0]])
                    (centerX, centerY, width, height) = box.astype("int")
                    
                    # Extract top left corner
                    x = int(centerX - (width / 2))
                    y = int(centerY - (height / 2))
                    boxes.append([x, y, int(width), int(height)])
                    confidences.append(float(confidence))
        
        # Apply Non-Maxima Suppression to filter overlapping boxes
        indices = cv2.dnn.NMSBoxes(boxes, confidences, 0.5, 0.4)
        
        # Draw bounding boxes on the frame
        if len(indices) > 0:
            for i in indices.flatten():
                x, y, w, h = boxes[i]
                cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)
                text = f"{LABELS[class_id]}: {confidences[i]:.2f}"
                cv2.putText(frame, text, (x, y - 5), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (0, 255, 0), 2)
        
        return frame

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing frame: {e}")
        return frame

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Process the frame
    output_frame = process_frame(frame)
    
    # Display the processed frame
    cv2.imshow('Traffic Monitoring', output_frame)
    
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release video capture object
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Explanation:
1. **YOLO Model Loading**: The program loads a YOLO pre-trained model for object detection. Make sure to download the necessary model weights, config files, and class labels (`coco.names`).

2. **Video Input**: It captures video from a file which simulates a traffic camera feed. You could replace `video_file` with a live feed URL or stream.

3. **Object Detection and Drawing**: The program processes each frame, detects vehicles (cars, buses, trucks), applies Non-Maxima Suppression to avoid overlapping boxes, and draws bounding boxes.

4. **Error Handling**: The program catches and prints out errors that may occur during frame processing.

5. **Resource Management**: It properly releases the video capture object and closes OpenCV windows when done.

This code provides a foundational step. Depending on your application, you might want to expand it by:
- Integrating a more sophisticated ML model.
- Implementing real-time reporting (e.g., using a web server).
- Analyzing traffic patterns to report congestion levels and incidents.
